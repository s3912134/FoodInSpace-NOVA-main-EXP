# Food-In-Space
A VR project created in Unity about testing the effects of consuming food within a simulated space-station environment. This project was initially created for the Programming Project 1 course by a team of 5 members. 

Version 2.0 Is an upgrade to the original project with new visuals and sounds. It also contains a new scene that is an empty white room.

# Dependencies
- Virtual Reality Setup
- Unity
- Windows
- Unity 2019 or later 
- PICO Unity integration kit 
- PICO VR device (PICO 3 & 4 Enterprise devices were used specifically) 
- VS Code or a similar integrated development environment for programming 
- Vuplex 3D Web View   
# Optional technologies: 
- PICO Live preview (For testing purposes) 


# Notes
The project contains multiple assets within the repo, which is responsible for the large repo size. An improvement to the project would be to separate out the models/textures / sound effects to a separate service or utilize git lfs to remove the bloat from the project.

# Deploying to a PICO device: 
- After you have generated an APK file connect a PICO device to the computer and move the APK into the internal shared storage for the device  
- Using the PICO device open the file explorer and navigate to the APK file. 
- Select your APK and agree to the install notification.  
- Now you can go to the apps page on the PICO device and launch the application.
